Welcome to the first official blog post about the server!

In preparation for the server release, we'll be going over a couple of the server's features over the next few days. 

If you weren't able to tell by the title, we'll be going over mutators.

<h2 style="font-size: 2.5em; margin-top:1.25em">What is a mutator?</h2>

<p style="font-size: 1.25em; text-align:center; opacity:50%; margin-bottom:2em;">A mutator in action</p>

Mutators are 30-second events that occur every 7 minutes. 

However, all mutators happen on the PvP map! These mutators "mutate" the gameplay!

The mutator displayed above plays like a Hypixel Party Game, with plenty of anvils dropping around you. An anvil dropping on you will squash you to death.

We have plenty more mutators that you can see when the server releases for beta on [REDACTED].

Hopefully we'll see you soon!
